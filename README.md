This is an unfinished work from a research paper implementation related to usable privacy and security.
The aforementioned paper "Securing Social Media User Data : an Adversarial Approach" can be found here :- https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00519

The paper proposes a novel de-anonymization approach called Adversarial Technique for Heterogeneous Data (ATHD) to test the effectiveness of various state-of-the-art anonymization approaches.
The proposed approach tackles both structural and textual anonymization in social media datasets. 

To test the credibility of the claimed results, we collected social media user data from popular apps like Twitter and Foursquare. 
Some of the mentioned state-of-the-art anonymization approaches like sparsification and perturbation have been implemented on the datasets.

Further work would likely aim at implementing the rest of the anonymization approaches, as well as try to implement the ATHD technique to obtain the said results.
